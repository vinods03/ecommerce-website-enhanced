app.component.html:

common "header" class and router-outlet.

The header class is flex.
keep the 3 items in the header equally distanced, so justify-content is space-between.
you need the header spread across the page, hence gap of 560px between the items.
height of 100px to get a fairly thick header.

Note the usage of img-header class for picture size.

----------------------------------- forms ----------------------------------------

authentication.component.html & checkout.component.html:

This has a form. So basically all labels / input boxes will come one after the other.
Note: without below, the form was too wide:
form {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

The "form-class" aligns the form horizontally & vertically at the center.
The label class controls font-size, font-weight etc of labels.
The select class controls drop-down box look & feel (checkout form).
The input class controls the input boxes look & feel.

No special styling for inbuilt class form-control.
For the class "text-danger", we define color: red & justify horizontally at the center.

Note label class is in-built & form-class is custom.
So in css, label class will be specified as label & form-class will be specified as .form-class.

------------------------------------

products-by-product-category.component.html:

master class is "products-by-categories" & the child classes are "aside" and "product-list".

products-by-categories is defined as a grid of 2 columns - aside 200px & product-list 1000px.
aside is flex but items inside are arranged downwards, so flex-direction is column.
product-list is again a grid of 4 columns, each of width 300px.

-------------------------------------

product-details.component.html:

The main class is "product-details" which is neither flex nor grid and it is centered.
This class has other classes "product-name", "product-description", "product-price" for font size, font weight, margin, color.
These are also neither flex nor grid.
The width property in "product-description" class helped in better centering and better looks.

We have a different img class here for bigger image than the one in the header.

------------------------------------------

cart-status.component.html:

The main class is "cart-status".
Note that the icon & the numbers (price + quantity) next to each other. But, the numbers (price & quantity) must be below each other.
So we have another class "cart-status-numbers" under cart-status for holding the numbers one below the other -> vertical.
img & cart-status-numbers are the childrn of cart-status -> horizontal.
A gap of 10px between the icon and the numbers.

--------------------------------------------

cart-details.component.html:

The master class is "cart-details".
Under this 4 classes: "cart-items" & "total-quantity-cart-details"/"total-price-cart-details" & "cart-final" - one below the other.
So "cart-details" has display: flex & flex-direction as column.

"cart-items" must show product name, price, quantity, remove button next to each other -> so display: flex (& default flex-direction row takes into effect).
"total-quantity-cart-details"/"total-price-cart-details" come next - one below the other. You couldd have a master class for these 2 and specify flex-direction as column.
"cart-final" has all buttons next to each other  -> so display: flex (& default flex-direction row takes into effect).
