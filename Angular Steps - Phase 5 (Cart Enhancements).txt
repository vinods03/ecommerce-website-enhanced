In cart-details, if i add the same product twice, it shows as 2 separate items.
I want to show it as a single item with a quantity of 2.

So here is where i realised the need for a separate Item interface different from Product interface.
This will have addnl attribute quantity and wont have some of the product attributes like sku, dateCreated etc.


ng g i models/Item

export interface Item {
  category_id: number;
  unit_price: number;
  image_url: string;
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  quantity: number;
}

Had to make quite a few changes:

Started with cart-details.component.html - added a placeholder for item.quantity - forced to change Product[] to Item[] in cart-details.component.ts
Also forced to make changes in styles.css - added product-quantity class and adjusted product-name width

Next, we will look at products-by-product-category.html & ts files because cart items are added from here.
Removed the existing addToCart(product) function and instead added:
addProdToCart(product: Product) {
    this.cartService.addProdToCart(product);
  }
In cart.service.ts -> added this function addProdToCart.
From product attributes, created an Item object and then invoked addToCart(item).
In this function, we have the logic to update item quantity.
The calculateTotals function was also updated to take into account the item quantity when calculating the total number of items in the cart.

In product-details.component.ts & html files, replaced addTocart function with addProdToCart function.
In the html file, even though the rendering was happening fine, the console was throwing an error:
ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'imageUrl')
Went through StackOverflow. This article was good:
"I can only assume that your "shared" service isn't resolving productByBarCode variable before view tries to reach it. 
In that case your code is trying to resolve imageUrl from null.
You can just *ngIf check if productByBarCode is truthy/falsy like this:
<td>
    <img *ngIf="productByBarCode" align="center [src]="productByBarCode.imageUrl" />
</td>
"
So added this: *ngIf="product" and the error was eliminated.
